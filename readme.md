# OnionFruit Connect

OnionFruit Connect is a lightweight, streamlined Tor connector tool that allows the user to connect their computer to the Tor network in seconds. It works as a proxy, meaning any application using it will be routed through the network.

## What can it do?

* Connect you to the Tor Network
* Select the output Country (US, GB, ES, etc.)
* Automatically Maintain GeoIP and Server Lists (For Exit Country Selection)
* Boot at startup and auto connect
* Set custom landing pages

## Getting Started
If you have no idea where to start, we recommend you take a look at the Getting Started Page in the Wiki. It's also full of extra info that you may find useful if you're ever stuck.

## Licence
Each component of OnionFruit is licenced differently, as we use some open source and some propriatary assembiles, which means we will disclose some source code, but not all of it.
For more info check the `LICENCE` file in this repo.
